Using CIFAR-10 as inputs, compare the image classification between full-feedforward network with convolutiona neural network
about my model: using 3 layer kernel depth: 64/128/128, kernel stride 1 padding:1 pooling size:2, pooling stride:2 fc size:64
the trainning accracy is 78.9% and the test accuracy is 76%
